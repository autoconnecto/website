# Autoconnecto Website (Next.js)

## What it is (confirmed)

`website/` is a Next.js 15 App Router project primarily intended as a marketing/landing site.

**Repository:** the canonical remote is **`https://github.com/autoconnecto/website`**. When this folder still lives inside **`autoconnecto-workspace`**, use [`docs/WEBSITE-STANDALONE-REPOSITORY.md`](../docs/WEBSITE-STANDALONE-REPOSITORY.md) in the workspace to split it out and optionally re-add it as a **git submodule**.

Confirmed dependencies:
- Next.js `15.1.11`
- React `19.0.3`
- Tailwind CSS

## How to run (confirmed)

From `website/`:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` (runs `next dev -p 4028`)
- `npm run build` (runs `next build`)
- `npm run serve` (runs `next start`)

Note: `npm run start` currently runs `next dev -p 4028` (see `website/package.json`).

## Static export (confirmed)

`next.config.mjs` sets:
- `output: "export"` (static export)
- `images.unoptimized: true`

Build ignores:
- TypeScript build errors (`typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true`)
- ESLint during builds (`eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true`)

## Production build & SEO (www + apex)

- Set **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`** to your **primary** marketing origin (no trailing slash), e.g. `https://www.autoconnecto.in`, in **CI and local** before `npm run build`. It is baked into `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, canonical tags, and Open Graph. See **`.env.example`**.
- Upload the full **`out/`** bundle to hosting for **each** hostname that should serve the marketing site. If apex and www both serve the site, use the **same** build so `robots.txt` / `sitemap.xml` match. JSON-LD lists apex and docs as `sameAs` for discovery.
- If apex still 404s on `robots.txt` / `sitemap.xml` while `www` works, fix **CDN/S3 behaviors or redirects** (outside this repo).

## Current Status (confirmed)

- Landing page is composed from section components under `src/app/components/*`.
- SEO metadata, sitemap, and robots routes are implemented.
- No confirmed integration with the platform backend exists in `website/src` in this snapshot.

## Next Priorities (recommended)

- Decide whether the website should stay fully static or integrate with platform services (contact form, signup links, etc.).
- Remove ignored build errors once stable.
- Ensure referenced assets (e.g., `/assets/images/app_logo.png`) exist in the final static hosting output.
